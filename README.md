# JsonCryption
## Field-level Encryption during JSON Serialization
JsonCryption offers field-level encryption when serializing from .NET objects to JSON, using `Microsoft.AspNetCore.DataProtection` for encryption, key/algo management, etc.

## !OBSOLETE!
Refer to the corresponding independent project for your particular serializer:
- [JsonCryption.Newtonsoft](https://github.com/Burwin/JsonCryption.Newtonsoft)
- [JsonCryption.Utf8Json](https://github.com/Burwin/JsonCryption.Utf8Json)

(These packages are completely independent of each other, so they should be treated as such. Hence, they're now split out from under this umbrella JsonCryption parent repository.)
